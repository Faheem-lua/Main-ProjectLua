## About Me (Faheem) and This Lua Project with Touka

Hi there! I'm Faheem, and this project is a personal exploration into the world of Lua programming. I've been diving into Lua to learn its flexibility and power, and this particular endeavor involves **experimenting with game development concepts, specifically character interaction and movement.**

A key aspect that makes this project unique and exciting for me is the involvement of "Touka." **101Jackniku is a central character in this little game prototype whose actions and abilities I'm scripting using Lua.** I'm focusing on making her movements feel fluid and responsive.

Through this project, I'm aiming to **solidify my understanding of Lua's core features in a practical game development context and learn about game scripting workflows.** It's a learning process, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

Stay tuned for updates as the project develops!
